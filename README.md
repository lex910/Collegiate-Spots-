# Collegiate-Spots-
Ongoing Project Exploring Collegiate Sports Data 

## Business Objectives: 
This project aims to uncover trends in a mock dataset for collegiate sports data. Using three different tables, ticket data, donor data, and email data, a comprehensive data analysis project will provide insights on customer types and sports that are driving the most revenue generation, ticket price levels to advertise to different customer segments, a comprehensive analysis of donor trends, and the performance of email campaigns. 

## Methods
Using the three datasets, Machine Learning Methods will be used to create customer segmentations based on purchasing habits, and models to predict future behaviors and interaction. Tableau will be used to create analytical dasboards to display findings in the data. 

## Data Dictionary 
** It is important to note that the data used to complete ths project is mock data and completely randomly generated resulting in some infeasible solutions. All methods are used properly, conclusions may just not make complete sense based on the generated data. For example some sales dates are after purchase date, meaning people purchased after the event happened.
